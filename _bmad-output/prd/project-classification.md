# Project Classification

**Technical Type:** SaaS B2B Platform (Two-Sided Marketplace)
**Domain:** General
**Complexity:** Medium
**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project with reference documentation for continuity

This is a **SaaS B2B marketplace platform** with medium complexity driven by:
- Multi-role architecture (4 distinct user personas: Uploaders, Creators, QA Editors, Admins)
- Complex workflow orchestration (upload → transcription → task routing → creation → QA → delivery)
- Creator advancement and quality management systems
- Payment processing and earnings calculation
- Fraud prevention and security requirements

The platform requires sophisticated state management, role-based access control, real-time updates, and integration with third-party services (audio transcription, payment processing, plagiarism detection).
