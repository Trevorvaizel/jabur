# Product Brief: jabur

**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Author:** Omen

---

## Executive Summary

**jabur** is an AI Podcast to Human-Curated Content Platform that transforms raw AI-generated podcast audio into polished, actionable content through a curated marketplace of skilled human experts. The platform addresses the proliferation of AI podcasts that lack the human touch, insight, and practical value needed for real-world application.

**Core Offering:** A two-sided marketplace connecting content uploaders (podcast creators, educators, entrepreneurs) with vetted content creators who transform audio into valuable derivative outputs: summaries, insights, reflection questions, blog posts, social media content, and fact-checked reports.

**Business Model:** Transaction-based platform capturing 35-40% margin while ensuring quality through a 5-tier creator level system, comprehensive QA review, and robust fraud prevention measures.

**Key Success Metrics (Year 1):** 1,000 monthly active uploaders, 200 active creators, <48hr turnaround time, >4.5/5 creator satisfaction, 60% uploader retention, <1% fraud rate.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

AI-generated podcasts are proliferating across the internet, but they consistently lack three critical elements:

1. **Polish and Refinement** - Raw AI audio lacks the human touch needed for professional use
2. **Contextual Insight** - AI misses nuanced analysis and expert perspective that humans provide
3. **Actionable Value** - Lengthy AI content needs distillation into practical takeaways

Content creators, educators, and entrepreneurs need digestible summaries, expert analysis, thought-provoking questions, and quality-assured information from AI podcasts - but currently have no efficient way to obtain this at scale.

### Problem Impact

**For Content Uploaders:**
- Hours spent listening to lengthy AI podcasts without efficient extraction of value
- Inability to repurpose AI audio into blog posts, social media, or educational materials
- No quality assurance on AI-generated information accuracy
- Time-poor professionals who need content fast but lack bandwidth to curate themselves

**For Potential Creators:**
- Skilled writers and analysts lack steady, flexible work opportunities
- Existing freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr) lack specialized workflows for audio content curation
- No clear growth path or quality-based advancement system

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Competitor Type | Examples | Gap |
|-----------------|----------|-----|
| **Transcription Services** | Otter.ai, Rev | Provide text conversion only - no curation, analysis, or derivative content creation |
| **AI Summarization Tools** | Snipd, Podcastle, ChatGPT | Lack human expertise, quality control, and creative interpretation |
| **Content Marketplaces** | Fiverr, Upwork | Generic gig platforms without specialized audio workflows or abstracted marketplace experience |
| **AI Tools** | Claude, GPT-4 | No human verification, creativity, or quality assurance layer |

**None offer:** Specialized audio content curation + human expertise + quality-tiered workforce + task-based creator experience.

### Proposed Solution

**jabur** creates a unique marketplace positioned at the intersection of AI content and human creativity:

**For Uploaders (Clients):**
- Upload AI podcast audio (up to 500MB)
- Select desired output types (9 curated content formats)
- Receive professional, human-curated deliverables within 24-48 hours
- Transparent pricing with rush options available
- Quality guaranteed through multi-tier review system

**For Creators (Workers):**
- Access to steady, task-based content creation work
- Clean, distraction-free workspace with synced audio player and transcript
- Fair compensation with growth opportunities (5-tier advancement: Probationary → Junior → Mid-Level → Senior → Expert)
- Rate multipliers from 0.8x to 1.5x based on performance and skill level
- Weekly payouts with $20 minimum threshold

**Platform Intelligence:**
- Automatic transcription (AssemblyAI/Whisper)
- Level-based task routing ensuring appropriate skill matching
- Plagiarism and AI-content detection for quality assurance
- Comprehensive fraud prevention and role separation enforcement
- QA review workflow with rubric-based scoring

### Key Differentiators

1. **Role Isolation Design Philosophy**
   - Creators experience a task-based system, NOT a gig marketplace
   - Never see client names, client pricing, or platform margins
   - Reduces marketplace anxiety and focuses on quality work

2. **5-Tier Creator Level System**
   - Clear advancement path from Probationary to Expert
   - Automatic task filtering by qualification level
   - Rate multipliers reward skill development
   - Admin oversight with manual promotion/demotion capability

3. **Specialized Audio Content Workflow**
   - Purpose-built for podcast curation, not generic freelancing
   - Synced audio player with waveform, variable speed, keyboard shortcuts
   - Rich text editor with auto-save and quality checks
   - Built-in plagiarism and AI-detection tools

4. **Comprehensive Quality Assurance**
   - Dual-layer review: Editor QA + optional client revision
   - Rubric-based scoring across 6 dimensions
   - Account flagging system for quality, plagiarism, or deadline issues
   - Auto-detection triggers for problematic patterns

5. **Fraud Prevention Architecture**
   - Device fingerprinting and email normalization
   - Role separation enforcement (client/creator isolation)
   - Velocity checking and behavioral anomaly detection
   - Payment fraud prevention with transaction monitoring

6. **Market-Specific Payment Integration**
   - Stripe and PayPal for global reach
   - **Pesapal/M-Pesa integration for East African market**
   - Weekly batch payouts reducing transaction fees
   - Transparent pricing with volume discounts

**Competitive Moat:** The combination of role isolation, tiered creator system, specialized workflow, and comprehensive fraud prevention creates a defensible position that would be difficult for generic marketplaces or pure-AI solutions to replicate.
