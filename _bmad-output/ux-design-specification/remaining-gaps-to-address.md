# REMAINING GAPS TO ADDRESS

### CRITICAL (Must Solve Before Launch):
None - all critical gaps now have solutions

### MODERATE (Should Solve Soon):
1. **Format examples library** - Create real sample formats for each type
2. **Subscription management UX** - Design subscription dashboard, pause/cancel flow
3. **Enterprise/team accounts** - Multi-user access, billing, reporting
4. **Creator specialty matching** - Route tech podcasts to tech-savvy creators, etc.

### LOW (Nice to Have):
5. **International expansion** - Multi-language support, currency, payment methods
6. **API access** - For power users to automate uploads
7. **Zapier integration** - Auto-upload from podcast hosting platforms
8. **White-label option** - For agencies/brands to use jabur backend with their branding
