# Executive Summary

This document captures the complete creator user experience design for jabur, an AI-powered podcast-to-content curation platform. The design covers the entire creator lifecycle from application through expert-level performance, with a focus on psychological safety, efficient workflows, and quality-driven outputs.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Project-First Architecture** - Projects are mandatory containers for all work, ensuring consistency and knowledge continuity
2. **Adaptive Support** - Creator experience level determines the type and frequency of guidance provided
3. **Anonymity with Communication** - Creators remain anonymous to clients while enabling necessary clarifications through QA intermediaries
4. **Skills-Based Matching** - Multi-signal skill profiling ensures right creator for right task
5. **Multi-Region Support** - Dual payout systems serve both East African (M-Pesa) and international (bank transfer) creators
