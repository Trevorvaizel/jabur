# DESIGN DECISIONS SUMMARY

### Key Decisions Made:

1. **High-Agency Transfer Model:** Give 1 FREE human-curated format (not AI summary) - users experience value through use
2. **Progress Save Points:** Save state at all major steps - users resume where they left off
3. **Dynamic Delivery Promises:** Check system state before promising delivery time - manage expectations
4. **Usage-Based Conversion Timing:** Upsell 48hrs after DOWNLOAD (not delivery) - align with usage timeline
5. **Buddy Support (Opt-In):** Proactive but optional support after first rejection - prevent churn
6. **Transcription Transparency:** Separate transcription step with notification - don't promise creator work before ready
7. **Format Visibility:** Show all 8 formats categorized - prevent "what if" regret
8. **Payment Retry Flows:** Graceful handling of payment failures - don't lose conversions
9. **Frequency-Based Subscription Push:** Only push subscription to high-frequency uploaders - respect low-frequency users
10. **Community Celebration:** Discord announcements for first approvals - create moments of delight
