# PART 3: PRICING & ECONOMICS (REVISED)

### 3.1 Pricing Strategy

**FREE TIER:**
- ONE human-curated format of user's choice
- Delivered in 6 hours
- Full quality (QA-approved, same as paid)
- Purpose: Prove value through use

**FULL SUITE PRICING:**

**Option A: Skip Free, Buy Upfront**
- $47 for all 8 formats
- No wait (if episodes are batched/pre-curated)
- For users who want everything now

**Option B: Free Format First, Then Upsell**
- FREE: 1 format (user choice)
- $39: Remaining 7 formats (after they use the free one)
- Total value: $86 if bought separately ($47 + $39)
- Perceived savings: "Got 1 free + paid $39 = saved $8"

**Option C: À La Carte (For Objection Handling)**
- $8 per individual format
- For users who only want 2-3 specific formats
- Example: Free newsletter + $8 LinkedIn + $8 Twitter = $16 total
- Only offered if they reply saying "$39 is too much"

### 3.2 Economics Model

**Cost Structure (Per Episode):**
- Creator payout: $15 for all 8 formats (bulk rate)
- QA payout: $2 per episode review
- Platform cost: $17 total per episode

**Revenue Model:**

**Scenario 1: Free Format Only (No Conversion)**
- Cost: $2 (1 format at ~$2 creator payout)
- Revenue: $0
- Loss: -$2

**Scenario 2: Free Format → Full Suite Upsell**
- Cost: $17 (all 8 formats)
- Revenue: $39
- Profit: $22

**Scenario 3: Skip Free, Buy Full Suite Upfront**
- Cost: $17
- Revenue: $47
- Profit: $30

**Conversion Math (Assumptions):**
- 100 uploads
- 80% choose free format (80 uploads)
- 20% buy full suite upfront (20 uploads)
- 30% of free format users convert to paid (24 conversions)

**Revenue:**
- Upfront buyers: 20 × $47 = $940
- Upsell conversions: 24 × $39 = $936
- Total: $1,876

**Costs:**
- Free format only: 56 × $2 = $112
- Upsell conversions: 24 × $17 = $408
- Upfront buyers: 20 × $17 = $340
- Total: $860

**Profit: $1,016 per 100 uploads**
**Profit per upload: $10.16**
**Conversion rate: 44% (24 upsells + 20 upfront / 100 uploads)**

- Rush delivery (2 hours)
- Dedicated creator team
- Account manager
