# FLOW 6: CREATOR ONBOARDING FLOW (Application → Training → First Task)

[Previous Flow 6 Mermaid diagram - with Sophia's buddy support added]

### Flow Optimizations Implemented

**Buddy Support for First Rejection** (Sophia + Sally's recommendation):

Post-rejection email (opt-in framing):
```
Subject: Your first task feedback + optional support

Hi Maria,

Your first task score: 2.1/5 - needs improvement.

Here's the QA feedback: [specific feedback]

---

Want help improving?

Experienced creator Sarah (250+ approved tasks) offers free 15-min
support calls for new creators. She'll review your work, share tips,
and answer questions.

[Schedule 15-min call with Sarah] [No thanks, I'll try on my own]

Most creators get feedback on early tasks - it's part of learning
our quality bar. You've got this!

— The jabur Team
```

**Why this works:**
- Opt-in (user chooses, not forced)
- Immediate value (concrete benefit)
- Social proof (normalizes struggle)
- Encouraging tone (not punitive)

**Discord Encouragement** (Sally's fix - P2):
- After first task claimed, tooltip: "💡 Most creators get peer feedback on their first task - it helps!"
- Links to #first-task-feedback Discord channel
- Optional but encouraged
