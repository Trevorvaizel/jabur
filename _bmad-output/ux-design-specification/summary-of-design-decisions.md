# Summary of Design Decisions

### Critical Decisions Made

1. **Projects are mandatory** - Forces organization from upload moment, eliminates retroactive chaos
2. **Three-layer standards hierarchy** - Platform → Project → Task ensures quality with flexibility
3. **Upload from inside project** - Project-first interface reduces friction for series creators
4. **Creator access to project history** - Enables consistency across series, creators learn client preferences
5. **Adaptive reminders based on experience** - New creators get comprehensive guidance, experts work independently
6. **Discord for community** - Leverage existing platform instead of building custom community
7. **QA as communication intermediary** - Maintains creator anonymity while enabling necessary clarifications
8. **Dual payout system** - M-Pesa for East Africa, bank transfer for international creators
9. **CV collection with AI analysis** - Multi-signal skill profiling for accurate task matching
10. **Markdown as primary format** - Creators write once, auto-generate PDF/DOCX/JSON as needed
