# PART 3: NOTIFICATION STRATEGY - PERSONALIZED CUSTOMER SERVICE

### 3.1 Event-Driven Notification Architecture

**5 Core Touchpoints + 1 Critical Gap-Filler**

```
TOUCHPOINT 1: Upload Confirmed
├─ Trigger: File upload complete
├─ Timing: Within 30 seconds of upload
├─ Personalization: File name, duration, detected quality
├─ Tone: Warm confirmation + clear next steps
├─ Purpose: Immediate reassurance
└─ Example: "We've got your episode, [Name] 🎙️"

TOUCHPOINT 2: AI Summary Ready
├─ Trigger: AI transcription complete
├─ Timing: 2-5 minutes post-upload
├─ Personalization: Episode name, themes detected, word count
├─ Tone: Value delivery + soft upsell
├─ Purpose: Build trust through free value
├─ CTA: "View summary + unlock human curation"
└─ Example: "Your AI summary is ready, [Name] ✨"

TOUCHPOINT 2.5: Mid-Creation Check-In ★ CRITICAL
├─ Trigger: IF human format ordered AND 6+ hours elapsed
├─ Timing: Midpoint of creation window (6-12 hours)
├─ Personalization: Creator name, specific progress details
├─ Tone: Transparency + care
├─ Purpose: Fill the anxiety gap ("is anyone working?")
├─ Content: What creator has done, what's left, ETA
└─ Example: "Quick update on '[Episode Title]'"

└─ Example: "Your newsletter content is ready, [Name] 🎉"

TOUCHPOINT 4: Payment Reminder
├─ Trigger: Content delivered but not paid
├─ Timing: 24 hours post-delivery
├─ Personalization: What they're leaving behind, effort invested
├─ Tone: Gentle reminder + re-state value
├─ Purpose: Convert without pressure
├─ Psychology: FOMO + sunk cost ("already curated for you")
└─ Example: "Your content is waiting, [Name]"

TOUCHPOINT 5: Abandonment Recovery (Future)

├─ Timing: 48 hours post-upload

- "Want the human touch?" = aspirational framing
- "No pressure" = escape hatch (reduces anxiety)

**NOTIFICATION 2.5: Mid-Creation Check-In** ★ **CRITICAL TRUST BUILDER**
```
Subject: Quick update on "[Episode Title]"

Hi [Name],

Just wanted to let you know - your content is actively being curated.

Sarah (Level 3 Creator, 89 projects completed) is working on your newsletter
content right now. She's:

✓ Reviewed your full 42-minute transcript
✓ Identified 7 key themes for your audience
✓ Now crafting your opening hook

Estimated delivery: 4 more hours

You'll get an email the moment it's ready for review.

— The Jabur Team

P.S. All content goes through our QA process before reaching you.
We take this seriously.
```

**Emotional Architecture:**
- "actively being curated" = present tense (happening now)
- "Sarah (Level 3, 89 projects)" = competence + human touch
- "She's: ✓ ✓" = visible progress (not generic "working on it")
- "4 more hours" = specific timeline (trust building)
- "We take this seriously" = institutional commitment

**Why This Exists:**
- Fills the 6-24 hour "black hole" between order and delivery
- Prevents "did they forget about me?" abandonment
- Humanizes the process (Sarah, not "our team")
- Demonstrates actual work in progress

### 3.4 Tone Guidelines: "Institutional Warmth"

**Definition:** Professional competence + genuine care. Not corporate cold, not startup casual.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Clarity over cleverness**: "Your content is ready" > "We've crafted something special"
- **Specificity over vagueness**: "4 more hours" > "Soon"
- **Warmth without fluff**: "We've got this" > "We're super excited to..."
- **Confidence without arrogance**: "Guaranteed quality" > "The best quality you'll find"

**Language Patterns:**
- ✅ "We're on it" / ❌ "We're super pumped!"
- ✅ "This is yours" / ❌ "This is absolutely amazing content we made for you!"
- ✅ "Sarah just finished" / ❌ "Sarah worked her magic on..."
- ✅ "Need changes? Reply." / ❌ "If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to..."

**Emoji Usage:**
- Sparingly and purposefully
- 🎙️ (content-related), ✨ (quality/delivery), 🎉 (completion)
- Never: 😊 🔥 💪 (too casual)

**Formality Spectrum:**
```
Too Cold          Sweet Spot         Too Casual
    |                  |                  |
"Dear User"      "Hi [Name]"      "Hey [Name]! 👋"
"Processed"      "Curated"        "Crushed it"
"Contact us"     "Reply"          "Hit us up"
```
