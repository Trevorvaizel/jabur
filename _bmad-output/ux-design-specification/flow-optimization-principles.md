# FLOW OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES

### 1. Minimize Steps to Value
- Upload flow: 3 clicks to free format (Upload → Pick format → Confirm)
- Creator flow: 1 click to claim task, immediate workspace access
- QA flow: Pre-loaded context (no searching for files)
- **Target:** First value delivered in <5 minutes

### 2. Reduce Cognitive Load at Decision Points
- Max 3 options at any decision point
- Use defaults + override (not blank slates)
- Provide examples/recommendations when choices unclear
- **Target:** Users shouldn't need to "think hard" to proceed

### 3. Provide Clear Feedback and Progress
- Every action gets immediate confirmation
- Progress indicators show "where am I" and "what's left"
- Celebrate milestones (first approval, tier promotion)
- **Target:** Users always know their status

### 4. Create Moments of Delight
- First approval: Discord community celebration
- Tier promotion: Animated badge + rate increase announcement
- Upload complete: "Your content is better than you could write yourself"
- **Target:** 3-5 delight moments per journey

### 5. Handle Edge Cases and Errors Gracefully
- Every error has recovery path (not dead ends)
- Errors explain WHAT happened and WHY
- Warnings (not errors) when users can still proceed
- **Target:** <5% error abandonment rate

### 6. Build Trust Through Transparency
- Show who's working on content (Sarah, Level 3 creator)
- Show progress in real-time (mid-creation check-in)
- Show calculations (rubric scores, tier progress, earnings)
- **Target:** Users feel "I know what's happening"

### 7. Enable Community Support
- Discord for creators (peer help on first task)
- Examples library for uploaders (see what formats look like)
- Public stats for transparency (1,247 episodes this month)
- **Target:** Users never feel alone/stuck

### 8. Save Progress at Critical Points (NEW)
- Auto-save state before potential abandonment
- Resume from last save point on return
- Reduce friction for return visitors
- **Target:** 25% improvement in completion rates for returning users
